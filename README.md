# OffShore-LaunchSite

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of Kerbal Konstructs statics that forms a pretty nice looking off-shore launch platform.

It is located on the equator roughly parallel to both the KSC launchpad and the Island Airfield.
Coordinates: Latitude = -0.1 Longitude = -72

There is a cost to open the base in career mode but its not terribly expensive. You can buy and sell fuel from the fuel tanks on the platform. 

You can launch rockets from it, but make sure they are not too big (it is decently sized but bigger rockets might clip into it).
There is also a helipad on the east side which can launch small helicopters or other VTOL craft from.

On the west side there is a landing zone for boosters, and if you overshoot that, there is a parked droneship a little bit more west.

The Launch Site has an elevator that goes to sea level so boats or amphibious craft can drive up to and drive onto the platform
There should be enough room to drive small rovers or cars around the various statics on the platform. 


There are even some easter eggs you can try to find ;)


Lastly, the Kunited States Navy has let the KSC use one of their Aircraft Carriers, and it is parked next to the platform.
You could launch and land small planes from there if you want to. but it won't be easy because the carrier is pretty small.

Dependencies:


I used a lot of niche statics to make this mod, and I don't want people to have to download a bunch of different files.
So for some of the mods I have included copies of them inside my mod. This way, you wont have to download them yourself. 
Ones marked with 'only static included' are included under the CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0 licence

If you have any suggestions on what to add, remove, or think the mod is terrible, just let me know on the forums: 
https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/236864-munktron239/


To Do:

- Adjust placements of all statics to be more precise

- Add length/width/height restrictions to the pads

- Add unique logos for each pad

- Remove some dependencies?

- Add more things in the water for boats

- maybe throw in some more Easter Eggs

- Fix billboard issue when KKWaterLaunchSites is not installed


In the future:

- mod support: provide support for planet scaling mods (JNSQ, etc)

- add it to other planets... Laythe, perhaps?
