# OffShore-LaunchSite

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of Kerbal Konstructs statics that form a pretty nice-looking off-shore launch platform.

It is located on the equator, roughly parallel to both the KSC launchpad and the Island Airfield.
Coordinates: Latitude = -0.1 Longitude = -72

There is a cost to open the base in career mode, but it's not terribly expensive. You can buy and sell fuel from the fuel tanks on the platform. 

You can launch rockets from it, but make sure they are not too big (it is decently sized, but bigger rockets might clip into it).
There is also a helipad on the east side which can launch small helicopters or other VTOL craft from.

On the west side, there is a landing zone for boosters, and if you overshoot that, there is a parked droneship a little bit more west.

The Launch Site has an elevator that goes to sea level, so boats or amphibious craft can drive up to and onto the platform.
There should be enough room to drive small rovers or cars around the various statics on the platform. 


There are even some easter eggs you can try to find ;)


Lastly, the Kunited States Navy has let the KSC use some of their Aircraft Carriers, and they are parked close to the platform.
You could launch and land small planes from them if you want to. But it won't be easy because the carriers are pretty small.
One carrier is facing East (HD270) and another is heading South (HD180).

# To Do:

- add length/width/height restrictions to the pads

- add unique logos for each pad

- add more things in the water for boats

- maybe throw in some more Easter Eggs



In the future:

- mod support: provide support for planet scaling mods
  - currently tested with: JNSQ - works
  - untested: RSS, KSRSS - unknown if works or not

- add it to other planets... Laythe, perhaps?
